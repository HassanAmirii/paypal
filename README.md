## About <a name="about"></a>

The **Expense Tracker API** is a complete backend solution for tracking personal finances. It provides a secure and scalable platform for users to manage their expenses. The application is built with **Node.js** and the **Express.js** framework, using **MongoDB** as its NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

This project goes beyond basic CRUD operations by implementing a full **JSON Web Token (JWT)** authentication system. This ensures that user data is protected and that each user can only access their own private expense records. The architecture is designed to be easily consumed by any modern frontend application.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- **Secure User Authentication**: Full user lifecycle management with `POST /register` and `POST /login` routes.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
- **JWT-based Authorization**: Protects API endpoints using a JSON Web Token, ensuring only authenticated users can access their private data.
- **Personalized Data**: Each expense is linked to a specific user, allowing users to view and manage only their own financial records.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Complete functionality to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** expenses.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
You also need to have **MongoDB** running locally on its default port.

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
