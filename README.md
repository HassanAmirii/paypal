# Expense Tracker API üí∞

Welcome to the **Expense Tracker API**, a robust backend solution designed for efficient personal expense management. Built with **Node.js** and the **Express.js** framework, this API provides a complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your financial records, utilizing **MongoDB** as its NoSQL database.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Create Expenses**: Easily add new expense records with detailed descriptions, amounts, and categories.
*   **Retrieve Expenses**: Fetch all expenses or retrieve specific expenses by their unique ID.
*   **Update Expenses**: Modify existing expense details as your financial situation changes.
*   **Delete Expenses**: Remove unwanted expense records from your collection.
*   **Category Enforcement**: Standardized expense categories (e.g., Groceries, Utilities) ensuring data consistency.
*   **Timestamping**: Automatic recording of the date for each expense entry.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Expense Tracker API locally on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HassanAmirii/paypal.git
    cd paypal
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **MongoDB Setup**:
    Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running locally. The application connects to `mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker` by default. If you need to use a different MongoDB URI or port, configure it in your environment variables as described below.

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and MongoDB is running, you can start the API server:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port). You should see `Database connected successfully!` and `paypal listening on localhost:3000/expenses` in your console.

# Expense Tracker API

## Overview
A robust RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, leveraging MongoDB for persistent storage, designed to manage personal expenses.

## Features
- `Express.js`: Facilitates the creation of a RESTful API with defined routes and middleware.
- `Mongoose`: Serves as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to interact with MongoDB.
- `MongoDB`: A NoSQL document database used for storing all expense records.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Refer to the 'Getting Started' section above for detailed installation instructions.

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker
```
*   `PORT`: The port on which the Express server will listen. (e.g., `3000`)
*   `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB database. (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker`)
